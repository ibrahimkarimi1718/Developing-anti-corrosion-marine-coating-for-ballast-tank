# Developing-anti-corrosion-marine-coating-for-ballast-tank
Formulation development and lab testing using design of experiment DOE, benchmarking, Field testing, commercialisation.
The aim was to develop, test, and launch a novel, high-performance marine coating for ballast tanks and challenging marine environments, ensuring long-term corrosion protection and commercial availability.

Key Objectives included:

Formulation Optimization: Systematically optimize the coating formula using Design of Experiments (DOE) to meet critical performance standards (e.g., adhesion, corrosion resistance).
Performance Validation: Rigorously benchmark the formulation against industry standards and competitors through comprehensive lab and Field Testing.
Commercial Readiness: Finalize application protocols, achieve necessary regulatory certifications, and transition the product to full-scale commercialization.
