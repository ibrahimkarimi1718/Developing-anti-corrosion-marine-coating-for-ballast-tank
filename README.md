# Developing-anti-corrosion-marine-coating-for-ballast-tank
Formulation development and lab testing using design of experiment DOE, benchmarking, Field testing, commercialisation.
The aim was to develop, test, and launch a novel, high-performance marine coating for ballast tanks and challenging marine environments, ensuring long-term corrosion protection and commercial availability.

Key Objectives included:

Formulation Optimization: Systematically optimize the coating formula using Design of Experiments (DOE) to meet critical performance standards (e.g., adhesion, corrosion resistance).
Performance Validation: Rigorously benchmark the formulation against industry standards and competitors through comprehensive lab and Field Testing.
Commercial Readiness: Finalize application protocols, achieve necessary regulatory certifications, and transition the product to full-scale commercialization.

The paint formulation consisted of control and graphene pigment containing variants

Paints manufacturing steps were taken as follows

The general properties of the paint were tested as follows

The test paints were total 8, two commercial, one graphene free primer developed inhouse and 5 graphene variants

The dry film thickness of the paints on steel test panels ranged between 160 to 200 microns for neutral salt spray, cyclic ageing and sea water immersion test

The neutral salt spray test and sea water immersion test showed comparable results of graphene variants to controls and not significant difference and sometimes even low performance

However, 4200 hours of cyclic ageing test, which is the closest test to real life exposure showed few graphene variants performing better than the controls. Here, CS1 aand CS2 are the commercial controls, GFS is the graphene free standard and then threre are 5 graphene variants

An overall summary of the paints performance in neutral salt spray, cyclic ageing and sea water immersion was plotted.

One graphene variant performed better in the cyclic ageing test compared to the commercial standard. The cyclic ageing test being regarded as the test which closely resembles the real-life exposure, performing better in that test was highly desirable

A further mechanical testing, specially tensile testing was proposed for the paints but it was not part of this project. Based on these results, one graphene primer variant was sucessfully commercialised.
